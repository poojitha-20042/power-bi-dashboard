CREATE A SALES DASHBOARD

Creating a sales dashboard in Power BI involves developing an interactive report that provides insights into sales trends, top-performing products, and regional performance. This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for businesses to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), identify growth opportunities, and make data-driven decisions.

REAL-TIME DASHBOARD

A real-time dashboard is a tool used to visualize and track key metrics and data in real time. It allows users to monitor performance, analyze trends, and make informed decisions based on live data streams. Real-time dashboards are commonly used in various industries such as business analytics, operations, finance, marketing, and IoT (Internet of Things).

INTEGRATION WITH PYTHON.

Integrating Python or R scripts into Power BI allows you to leverage the power of these programming languages for more advanced data analysis, transformations, or custom visualizations within Power BI. This can be particularly useful when you need to perform complex calculations or build sophisticated models that aren't readily available with Power BI's built-in features.

By showcasing Python in Power BI, you demonstrate how to combine the strengths of Pythonâ€™s data science capabilities with Power BI's powerful reporting and visualization tools. This allows for richer and more meaningful insights to be presented in a professional, interactive format.
